This contains a short introduction to Software Engineering concepts.


## Software Engineering
A disciplined, systematic approach to development aimed at creating reliable, scalable, and user-focused software.

## Modeling: 
The process of creating a "blueprint" or a deliberate simplification of a system to help teams understand and communicate its structure and behavior before writing code.
Purpose: 
Modeling helps avoid costly mistakes, manages complexity, and ensures the final product matches what stakeholders expect.

## Use Case Diagram (Functional View)
The first step in UML analysis, capturing system behavior from the perspective of an external user.

Main Elements:
Actor: 
Represents a role played by an external person or system interacting with your software.
Use Case: 
A unit of visible functionality that provides a specific service to an actor (e.g., "Withdraw Money").
Why we use it: It defines what the system does for its users without getting into the technical "how".

## Class Diagram (Static View)
Considered the most important UML diagram; it reveals the internal, static structure of the system.

Main Elements:
Class: 
A formal description (blueprint) of a set of objects with common properties (attributes) and behaviors (operations).
Relationships: 
Connections between classes such as Associations, Generalization , and Aggregation .

Why we use it: 
It provides the structural foundation for the code, defining the data and logic that will be implemented.

## Object Diagram (Snapshot View)

A representation of specific instances of classes and their links at a particular moment in time.
Why we use it: While the class diagram models the rules, the object diagram models the facts of a running system.

## Why We Use These Concepts
These concepts help organize software development, improve code quality, and ensure that software meets user requirements.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle describes the phases involved in building software:
- Requirements analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Maintenance

## DevOps
Emerging in the late 2000s, this model bridges development and operations teams through automation, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD).
Purpose: It helps deliver software faster and more reliably.

## DevSecOps
A modern evolution that integrates security practices into every stage of the development lifecycle.
Purpose: It ensures security is considered early, not added at the end.
